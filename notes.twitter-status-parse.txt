My notes on parsed twitter status objects:

In the entities object, we have:
user_mentions,
symbols,
trends,
hashtags,
and URLS

In the user_mentions object, we have what look like dictionaries that contain this:
ID (Twitter user ID),
indices (List with numbers of position of mention name), 
id_str (Twitter user ID as a string),
screen_name (The at twitter handle),
and lastly, name (Which is just the account's name).

In the remaining entries (symbols, trends, hashtags, and URLs), the items are just in lists, though trends I think has an indicies values, as does hashtags
